# Linear_Regression
 Project on EDA and Linear Regression 

Predicted students' chances of admission for higher education given other variables like GRE, TOEFL Score, GPA, University Rating etc for a project from an education platform during their latest feature launch using Linear Regression Algorithm.

Project involves 
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the data identifying shape and data types, missing value treatment along with Univariate and Bivariate analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Data Preprocessing: Feature Engineering, Encoding and Scaling
- Model building: Building Linear Regression models (L1, L2 Regularization, RFE based Model) and drawing preliminary insights
- Model Evaluation: Using  MAE, RMSE, R2 score, Adjusted R2.
- Actionable Insights and Recommendations
